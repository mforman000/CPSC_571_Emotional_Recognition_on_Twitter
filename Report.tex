\begin{abstract}
This report is going to cover the implemenation of an algoirthm that is used to determine the sentiment and emotion behind a given tweet.
We will discuss the pros and cons of existing methods and how a hybrid of these existing methods could create a more usable result.
Social media is a space which is utilized to express many sentiments and emotions. 
In many real world applications, it is important to identify these emotions efficiently and as accurately as possible. 
The ability to identify and predict emotional tone and public perception of various issues can be useful in many scenarios. 
For example, being able to differentiate between sarcasm and a person being serious on twitter can be difficult at times. 
With accurate emotional recognition algorithms, one may be able to understand when something is sarcasm vs when it is not and avoid some of the stress and anger a post may instill otherwise. 
As well, there is incentive from large corporations and governments to understand how the public is perceiving a new product or service. 
With this new knowledge, products and services could theoretically be changed to help positively effect the most amount of people.

\section{Literature Review}
There are many current studies that have also had intentions to create an algorithm to assign sentiment to tweets.  
From these studies, the following has been discovered.
Assigning sentiment should be split up into three categories, positive, neutral, and negative.
This separation of tweets has been used in several sentiment analysis studies.
For example this was the way tweets were separated in a study by Samah Jailani, Hamzah, Amunuddin, Abidin, and Riza in wich there algorithm "establishes whether a particular tweet is supportive, critical, or neutral\cite{b2}."
Emotion can also be assigned to tweets, these being split up into sections of anger, sadness, joy, fear, and disgust. 
In a study by Benrouba, and Boudour, IBM's natural language understanding API tool was used to analyze words associated with positive, negative and neutral emotions\cite{b1}.
This tools assigns values between 0 and 1 for emotions mentioned above per word. 
From here, tweets were analyzed to calculate distance to these baseline words in an unsupervised fashion in order to identify the sentiment behind it. 
As well, there was implemenations of this algorithm that focussed on desiphering the sentiment or emotion of a tweet on an individual scale, or on a more mass tweet scale.
The analysis in bulk was done mainly to understand how the public was percieving a certain topic of interest online. 
Whereas the individual assessment was more focussed on understanding how one person felt in general based on the sentiment behind their tweets. 
Through analyzing existing papers some pros and cons with exisiting methodologies were established. \newline
\newline
Pros: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proven accuracy of SVM (Support Vector Machine) algoirthm.
    \item Proven accuracy of BERTweet Self-supervised Algorithm.
\end{itemize}
Cons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Much fewer studies in which unsupervised algoirthms were tested in this context.
    \item There is a lot of overlap between neurtal, and positive and negative key words making it harder to determine sentiment.
    \item Very little in the way of good visualizations for the output of the algorithms.
\end{itemize}

As mentioned above, Taking an SVM approach was one of the most accurate in terms of supervised algorithms.
It out performed other algorithms of Sentiment Analysis accross multiple examined studies. 
An SVM works by indentifying "a hyperplane that distinguishably segregates the data points of differnt classes \cite{b6}." 
What this means is the data is expanded onto a multidimensional plane that is split up by the hyperplane. 
The hyperplane will have margins that expand to the size of the closest datapoint to it that falls immediately after the hyplane centre. 
This makes decision making faster and more effiecient. 
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{SVMVisualization.png}}
    \caption{Visualization of hyperplane from SVM \cite{b6}.}
\end{figure}
With modfications this strategy has been used not only to cover binary data, but through using a method called a "kernel trick\cite{b6}" it is used on multidimensional data as well. 
Using this technique achieved very impressive accuracy levels on sentiment analysis of tweets according to other studies.
For example, in the study by Kavitha, Prasad Reddy, and Venkata Rao, it was observed that "SA [Sentiment Analysis] using SVM classifiers is varying between 90.1 and 94.8\%\cite{11}."
As well, in the study by Susmitha, Nikhul, Akhil, Kavitha, Reddy, and Shailaja, SVM had an accuracy percentage of 82\%\cite{b5}. 
Despite the success of this algorithm with studies seeing accuracy levels in the 90th percentile there is still a much smaller amount of knowledge on how a new style of algorithm would keep up.
A newer "self-supervised\cite{b7}" algorithm that has burst onto the scene is BERT.\newline 

BERT is an example of a self-supervised model. 
What this means is that it uses the data input to train on like a supervised algorithm however the training of the algorithm is done in an unsupervised fashion.
"The unsupervised problem is transformed into a supervised problem by auto-generating the labels\cite{b9}" for the supervised algorithm.
In a study performed by Ionut-Alexandru and Stelian a hybrid of a "BERT and SVM Ensemble Model\cite{b8}" was used to detect emotions.
From this study they found very accurate results from combining the power of BERT and SVM with accuiracies in the 90th percentile.
From their results, the overall accuracy for their ensemble was 91\% \cite{b8}.
However their resulsts for BERT were 89\% \cite{b8}, which is very comparible to that of their ensemble.
These results can be seen in Figure 2.
This leads to the possibility of with different training and potentially more specific topics on tweets better results for BERTweet.

\begin{figure}[b]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{BERTweetChartFromStudy.png}}
    \caption{Results from Study from Ionut-Alexandru and Stelian\cite{b8}}
\end{figure}

While these results are impressive, proper visualizations of the results were not available other than in the format of these tables.
In a study mentioned above by Samah, Jailani, Hamzah, Aminuddin, Abidin, and Ria, more time was spent on displaying the data to users nicely.
Several different types of charts including pie charts, bar graphs, and histograms were used to clearly visualize the data.
This makes understanding the algorithms decision on what the public feels on a certain topic much easier compared to numbers in a chart.
An example of these charts can be seen in Figure 3. 
As well, in a study by Harshit D. Bhavani, they also created a web application to visualize the data\cite{b3}. 
However, both of these models have never used BERT or any other self-supervised algorithms with these visualizations.
This leaves a gap in the existing studies of nciely presented data using algorithms with superior accuracy, that may be able to be filled.

\section{Proposed Methodology}
\subsection{Data Collection}
Currently, our methodology is in an experimental phase and therefore, subject to change as we continue to test different methods. 
To implement our methodology using the BERTweet model we have to carry out the following steps. 
We start with the data collection step. 
Currently we are using labelled datasets from Kaggle which is described below for the purpose of understanding the accuracy of our model. 
Once accuracy is established, we may utilize the Twitter API for additional data. 
We are currently working with the Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset and the Swiggy dataset both which are very different in terms of the content. 
Our goal is to see how well our model could perform with tweets of different topics. 

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
The next step is to process the data. 
In the preprocessing step, we use the pandas library to filter out the columns which are not necessary.  
In addition, we will use the tweet-preprocessor library to process tweets and remove any unnecessary parts of the tweet which includes hash symbols, mentions, emojis, etc. 
This is important so that our model can focus solely on the textual information presented. 

\subsection{Finetuning}
Our next step is to finetune our model. 
We are using the BERT model for this purpose. 
BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. 
It is a deep learning model which was introduced by Google in 2018. 
This model makes use of a transformer which contains an attention mechanism. 
This allows the model to understand contextual relations between words in a text. 
The BERTweet model is based off of this BERT but is pretrained on a large corpus of tweets, making it suitable for our task. 
We believe this is the appropriate model to use because we intend to test the ability of unsupervised models in this particular case and BERTweet is an effective model for this task.


\subsection{Classification}
Using our finetuned model, we then classify our tweets based on positive, negative or neutral sentiment to allow us to determine sentiment on a particular issue.  
We will then aggregate all the predictions to get an overall view of the public sentiment given a particular dataset. 
We could do this by calculating the average sentiment score across all the tweets. 

\subsection{Visualization}
The next step is to visualize our data. 
As we have not yet obtained our results, we are currently planning to use bar graphs to show number of tweets with each sentiment. 
Firstly, we are planning to use a word cloud which specifies all the key words indicating positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. 
An example of this can be shown above.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{wordcloud.png}
    \caption{Example of word cloud\cite{b2}}
\end{figure}

 We also plan on including a bar graph showing the distribution of positive, negative and neutral tweets. 
 We will also add additional visualizations which we plan to show in the next step which is evaluating performance.
 In order to display this information to the user we will be implementing a web application using the Django Framework in python. 
 "Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development \cite{b14}."
 Given our shorter time frame, we believe that this framerwork will be able to give us the best product within the fastest timeframe.
 This is due to the fact that Django is consistent in their design principles and have lots of up-to-date documentation \cite{b15}. 





\subsection{Evaluation of Performance}
Evaluating the performance of our model involves a few metrics which need to be calculated. 
Prior to performing our calculations, we will display a confusion matrix which shows, true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives in a matrix. 
An example in python is shown below:


\begin{figure}[b]
    \includegraphics[width=0.5 \textwidth]{confusion_matrix.png}
    \caption{Example of confusion matrix in python}    
\end{figure}
The confusion matrix will be used to calculate multiple metrics including accuracy, performance, recall, and F1 score, the equations of which are as follows:

\begin{align}
    Accuracy &= (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)\\
    F1 &= 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)\\
    Precision &= TP / (TP + FP)\\
    Recall &= TP / (TP + FN)
\end{align}

\end{itemize}


\section{Implementation Requirements}
In this section, we delve deeper into the technologies selected for our sentiment analysis project on Twitter data, elaborating on their roles and integration points within the application.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python}: As our primary programming language, Python's flexibility and comprehensive ecosystem are pivotal. It will serve multiple roles: data collection and management through scripts for fetching tweets via the Twitter API, integration with machine learning models to refine or retrain BERTweet for enhanced accuracy, and driving our backend development with APIs for fetching analysis results, user management, and processed data delivery, leveraging the extensive capabilities of the Django framework. Python serves as the glue between the data and the sentiment analysis models. With libraries such as TensorFlow, we can further refine or even retrain models like BERTweet based on specific needs or to improve accuracy.
    
    \item \textbf{Django Framework}: The Django Framework is selected for its robustness, scalability, and ease of integration with Python's data science and machine learning libraries. It facilitates the rapid development of secure and maintainable web applications, providing out-of-the-box support for common web development tasks. This includes a powerful admin interface for easy data model management, making it simpler to handle large volumes of traffic and data efficiently. Django's security features protect our application from common vulnerabilities, ensuring a secure user experience. With Django, our backend is not only highly scalable but also adaptable, allowing our application to grow seamlessly as user demands and technologies evolve.
    
    \item \textbf{BERTweet}: BERTweet, a model trained specifically on tweets using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), is central to our project for performing sentiment analysis. It excels at classifying tweets into various sentiments and uncovering trends in public opinion, thanks to its training on a vast array of Twitter messages. This specialized focus on tweets means BERTweet is adept at understanding the nuances of short, informal text commonly found on social media. This capability makes it exceptionally suited for real-time analysis, offering insights into the public's reactions and sentiments on different topics, thereby enriching our project's analytical depth.

    \item \textbf{TweetPreprocessor}: The accuracy of sentiment analysis heavily relies on the quality of data fed into the model. This is where TweetPreprocessor comes into play. It's a tool designed to clean and standardize tweet data, stripping away extraneous elements like URLs, mentions, hashtags, and emojis. This preprocessing step is crucial because it removes noise that can distort analysis results. By normalizing the text, including converting slang and abbreviations to their standard forms, TweetPreprocessor ensures that BERTweet can perform at its best. This preparation is essential for accurately capturing the sentiments expressed in tweets.

    \item \textbf{Additional Tools and Libraries}: Our project leverages the power of Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and analysis. These libraries are fundamental for working with large datasets, allowing us to organize, clean, and analyze data with high performance and flexibility. For visualization, we turn to Matplotlib and Seaborn, which enable us to create informative and attractive visualizations. These tools help us to present our findings in a clear and accessible way, through charts, graphs, and dashboards that highlight key trends and insights derived from our sentiment analysis. This visual component is vital for communicating complex data in an understandable format to users.
\end{itemize}

The combination of these technologies and frameworks will enable the development of a comprehensive web application that leverages advanced sentiment analysis to provide valuable insights into various datasets, thereby meeting our project objectives.
